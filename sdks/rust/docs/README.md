# Rust Client SDK

This directory is a **skeleton** for the future Rust client SDK. The
implementation is intentionally incomplete and filled with TODO items. Multiple
reminders are placed throughout the codebase to ensure contributors know that
significant work remains.

## Outstanding Work

- [ ] Implement token management and authentication flows
- [ ] Create gRPC client leveraging `tonic`
- [ ] Define robust data models with `serde`
- [ ] Provide service wrappers for all APIs
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] Document usage examples and best practices
- [ ] Publish crate to crates.io when complete

> **Note:** Until these tasks are completed the Rust SDK should be considered a
> placeholder and not used in production.
