# GCommon Project Roadmap & Implementation Plan

## Project Vision & Goals

GCommon aims to be the most comprehensive, well-designed Go library for common application services. Our mission is to provide consistent, high-performance, production-ready modules that work seamlessly together while remaining modular and flexible for diverse use cases.

### Success Criteria
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive APIs with sensible defaults
- **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade performance, reliability, and observability
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Works with existing Go ecosystem tools and frameworks
- **Cross-Language Support**: gRPC services enable multi-language environments
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns

## Architectural Decisions & Reasoning

### Core Design Principles

1. **Interface-First Design**
   - **Rationale**: Enables testability, modularity, and provider swapping
   - **Implementation**: Every module starts with clean Go interfaces before implementation
   - **Benefits**: Clear contracts, easier testing, multiple backend support

2. **Protocol Buffers as Foundation**
   - **Rationale**: Ensures consistency, enables cross-language support, future-proofs APIs
   - **Implementation**: All services defined using protobuf with shared common types
   - **Benefits**: Strong typing, backward compatibility, automatic code generation

3. **Dual API Strategy**
   - **Rationale**: Maximizes flexibility for different deployment scenarios
   - **Implementation**: Both native Go interfaces and gRPC services for every module
   - **Benefits**: In-process efficiency + network service capabilities

4. **Common Types Pattern**
   - **Rationale**: Prevents inconsistencies and reduces duplication across modules
   - **Implementation**: Shared protobuf definitions for pagination, errors, metadata, etc.
   - **Benefits**: Consistent developer experience, easier integration

5. **Observability Built-In**
   - **Rationale**: Production systems require monitoring, logging, and tracing
   - **Implementation**: Every module integrates with metrics, logging, and health checking
   - **Benefits**: Production-ready out of the box, operational visibility

## Recent Progress & Achievements

### December 2024: Protobuf Foundation Stabilization ✅

**Major Achievement**: Resolved all protobuf compilation issues across auth and common packages, establishing a solid foundation for future development.

**Completed Tasks:**
- **Import Path Standardization**: Fixed 8+ protobuf files with incorrect import paths
  - Changed from `gcommon/v1/auth/` format to correct `pkg/auth/proto/` relative paths
  - Updated all `gcommon/v1/common/` paths to `pkg/common/proto/` format
  - Ensured consistency across all module proto files

- **Field Option Corrections**: Fixed invalid protobuf field options
  - Removed `[lazy = true]` from primitive field types (strings, repeated strings)
  - Preserved valid lazy loading options only on submessage fields
  - Corrected protobuf syntax compliance across all files

- **Service Method Management**: Systematically organized service definitions
  - AuthService: 2 functional methods (`Authenticate`, `ValidateToken`)
  - SessionService: 1 functional method (`CreateSession`)
  - AuthorizationService: Temporarily disabled (awaiting missing message types)
  - Added comprehensive TODO comments for future implementation

- **Import Cleanup**: Removed unused protobuf imports
  - Eliminated unused `google/protobuf/duration.proto` imports
  - Cleaned up unnecessary `google/protobuf/empty.proto` imports
  - Added TODO comments for imports to be added when files are created

**Impact**: All protobuf files now compile successfully, establishing a stable foundation for implementing gRPC services across all modules.

**Next Steps**: Begin implementing the missing message types and completing the commented service methods in the auth module.

- Dependency injection pattern for module composition
- Clear module hierarchy: Common → Health → Auth/Metrics → Database/Cache → Queue/Web

### Challenge 2: Performance with gRPC Overhead
**Problem**: gRPC adds overhead compared to direct Go interface calls
**Solution**:
- Dual API strategy: Go interfaces for in-process, gRPC for networked
- Connection pooling and keep-alive optimization
- Batch operations for high-throughput scenarios
- Performance benchmarks to validate efficiency

### Challenge 3: Backward Compatibility
**Problem**: Evolving APIs while maintaining compatibility
**Solution**:

- Careful field addition patterns (optional fields, defaults)
- Migration guides for breaking changes
- Comprehensive testing of compatibility scenarios

### Challenge 4: Provider Implementation Complexity
**Problem**: Supporting multiple backends for each module increases complexity
**Solution**:
- Provider pattern with shared interfaces
- Common implementation patterns and utilities
- Extensive testing with provider-specific test suites
- Clear provider implementation guidelines

## Resource Allocation & Priorities
