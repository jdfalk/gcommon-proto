# GCommon Protobuf Status Assessment - August 3, 2025

**Started**: 2025-08-03
**GitHub Copilot Assessment**
**Task**: Complete protobuf implementation and close finished issues

## Assessment Progress Tracker

### Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis

- [ ] Read all strategy documents
- [ ] Fetch and analyze all GitHub issues
- [ ] Examine current protobuf structure
- [ ] Run buf lint to check current status
- [ ] Analyze GitHub projects
- [ ] Check subtitle-manager requirements

### Phase 2: File Validation

- [ ] Validate each protobuf file individually
- [ ] Check for missing imports
- [ ] Verify 1-1-1 pattern compliance
- [ ] Test buf generate
- [ ] Document issues found

### Phase 3: Issue Management

- [ ] Categorize issues by status
- [ ] Identify truly completed issues
- [ ] Close completed issues with documentation
- [ ] Update remaining issues with current status
- [ ] Create new issues for remaining work

### Phase 4: Project Management

- [ ] Analyze existing projects
- [ ] Close completed projects
- [ ] Create new projects as needed
- [ ] Assign issues to projects
- [ ] Generate label automation list

### Phase 5: Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update strategy documents
- [ ] Create completion roadmap
- [ ] Document next steps for subtitle-manager integration

## Files Examined

**Total Protobuf Files**: 1,123 files
**Discovery Date**: 2025-08-03

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Massive Issue Duplication**:
   - Found hundreds of duplicate GitHub issues (same title/description)
   - Issues 769-868: Same 3 issues repeated multiple times
   - Need immediate cleanup

2. **Buf Lint Failures**:
   - Multiple RPCs using same request/response types
   - Unused imports in web.proto and metrics modules
   - Cache service has RPC conflicts

3. **File Content Analysis**:
   - Many files with exactly 17 lines (likely minimal stubs)
   - **CRITICAL**: Must validate actual content, not just existence
   - Many files likely contain only TODO comments or placeholder definitions
   - Need to check for actual message/service/enum definitions vs stubs
