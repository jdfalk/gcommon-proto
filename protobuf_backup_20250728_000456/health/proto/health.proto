/**
 * Main health module protobuf aggregation file.
 *
 * This file serves as the central import point for all health-related
 * protobuf definitions. Individual message types are defined in their
 * respective files following the 1-1-1 pattern:
 * - One message per file
 * - One file per message
 * - One responsibility per file
 *
 * Services are defined in:
 * - health_service.proto - Core health checking service
 * - health_admin_service.proto - Administrative health operations
 *
 * For backwards compatibility, this file can be imported to access
 * all health-related types and services.
