Each example is self-contained and\nincludes setup instructions.\n\n## Structure\n\n```\ndocs/examples/\n├── basic/       # Minimal examples for quick reference\n├── advanced/    # Complex scenarios combining multiple modules\n└── integrations/ # External system integrations\n```\n\n## Running Examples\n\n1. Clone the repository and navigate to an example directory.\n2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` within each example.\n3. Execute the provided commands to run the example.\n4. Review output and experiment with modifications.\n\n## Contribution Guidelines\n\n- Keep examples small and focused on a single concept.\n- Include comments explaining important steps.\n- Provide cleanup instructions when necessary.\n- Link to related guides and reference documentation.\n- Use the documentation update workflow for changes.\n\nMore examples will be added as modules mature.
