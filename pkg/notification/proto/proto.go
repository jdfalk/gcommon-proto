// Package notificationpb provides consolidated exports for notification protobuf types
// All types are generated into this single package from the modular proto files
package notificationpb

// This file serves as documentation and type organization for the generated protobuf types.
// All types from the various .proto files in subdirectories are generated directly into this package.
// No re-exports are needed since everything is already in the notificationpb package.
