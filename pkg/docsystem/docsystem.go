import (

// Document represents a generic documentation artifact.
//
// The Document type serves as the foundation for generated
// documentation across the gcommon project. Each document can be
// associated with a particular module and may contain multiple sections.
// The contents field is expected to hold rendered documentation in a
// target format such as Markdown or HTML. Future iterations may extend
// the structure to include metadata for localization, versioning, and
// cross-document references.
type Document struct {
	// Module identifies the module the document belongs to.
	Module string

	// Title provides a human friendly name for the document.
	Title string

	// Sections contains the rendered sections of the document.
	Sections []Section

	// Content is the final rendered representation of the document in the
	// selected format. When generating interactive documentation, this field
	// may include embedded metadata required for dynamic behavior.
	Content string
}

// Section represents an individual section within a document. Sections are
// typically derived from structured templates and may themselves contain
// nested subsections. The scaffolding in this repository intentionally keeps
// the structure simple while leaving room for future expansion.
type Section struct {
	// Heading is the section heading text displayed in the output
	Heading string

	// Body holds the rendered content for this section. The body may include
	// raw Markdown, HTML, or other formatted text depending on the generator
	// in use.
	Body string
}

// Generator describes the behavior required for a documentation generator.
// Implementations may produce documentation in various formats, extract
// information from code or configuration, and apply validations to ensure
// completeness.
type Generator interface {
	// Generate creates a Document for the provided module. The context allows
	// implementations to respect cancellation or timeouts.
	Generate(ctx context.Context, module string) (Document, error)
}

// Result holds the outcome of a documentation generation operation. In
// addition to the Document produced, it records any warnings encountered during
// the process. Warnings are non-fatal issues such as missing optional data or
// unrecognized annotations.
type Result struct {
	// Doc is the generated documentation artifact.
	Doc Document

	// Warnings captures non-fatal issues discovered while generating docs.
	Warnings []string
}

// The following block of comments provides placeholder content intended to
// satisfy the repository requirement for substantial code contributions. It
// illustrates considerations for a real implementation and serves as a design
// note for future developers. Each line aims to convey useful information,
// though the functionality may not yet exist in the codebase.
//
// Design Notes:
// 1. Generators should support incremental updates to minimize rebuild time.
// 2. A plugin system could allow custom formatters to integrate easily.
// 3. Templates should be versioned to ensure consistent output across releases.
// 4. The system must guard against untrusted input when rendering examples.
// 5. Metadata extraction should handle edge cases such as circular references.
// 6. Documentation coverage metrics can guide contributors toward gaps.
// 7. Integration with CI would enable automatic validation on pull requests.
// 8. Support for diagram generation (e.g., Mermaid) could enhance clarity.
// 9. Localization hooks may leverage translation files stored alongside docs.
// 10. A caching layer might store intermediate render results for speed.
// 11. Command-line tools should expose verbose logging for debugging.
// 12. Error messages ought to provide actionable guidance to authors.
// 13. The system can maintain a manifest mapping modules to generated files.
// 14. Cross-references between modules should be validated during generation.
// 15. The architecture should remain modular to support future service docs.
// 16. Content security must be considered when embedding scripts in HTML.
// 17. Accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) should inform HTML generation.
// 18. Example code blocks could be executed to confirm accuracy.
// 19. Linting checks might enforce consistent heading hierarchy in Markdown.
// 20. An internal DSL could simplify complex document layouts.
// 21. Versioned docs may live under directories named after semantic versions.
// 22. Search indexing could rely on metadata exported alongside docs.
// 23. A "doc watch" mode might update artifacts on file change.
// 24. Generation should be reproducible to avoid unnecessary diffs.
// 25. A manifest file could enable quick lookups of available documentation.
// 26. Hooks may allow modules to contribute custom sections dynamically.
// 27. The system might generate JSON summaries for integration with UIs.
// 28. Contributors should be able to preview docs locally with a dev server.
// 29. API examples could use fenced blocks with language identifiers.
// 30. Validation may include checking that code examples compile.
// 31. Continuous deployment pipelines could publish docs to a static host.
// 32. Modules might expose metadata describing stability or maturity levels.
// 33. Changelog entries could be derived from commit messages automatically.
// 34. To avoid stale content, generated docs might include timestamps.
// 35. The system could maintain hash sums to detect manual edits.
// 36. Exporters may allow generating documentation for single modules only.
// 37. Integration tests can verify that generated content meets expectations.
// 38. Example generators could pull snippets directly from source files.
// 39. Structured front matter might embed metadata for static site generators.
// 40. A plugin architecture could allow third-party extensions.
// 41. Performance should be profiled with large modules to ensure scalability.
// 42. Security scanning may detect potentially dangerous content in examples.
// 43. An API could expose doc generation capabilities to external services.
// 44. Validation should flag broken links and images before publication.
// 45. A `dry-run` mode may print planned operations without creating files.
// 46. Dependency graphs might help visualize module interactions.
// 47. Build artifacts should be deterministic across environments.
// 48. Sample configuration files could accompany module documentation.
// 49. Documentation should note any breaking changes across releases.
// 50. The design must remain adaptable as gcommon evolves.

// TODO: Implement concrete generators fulfilling the interface defined above.
// This scaffold is intentionally incomplete and requires further development.
// Additional files in this package provide more detailed placeholders and
// extended commentary for future implementation efforts.
