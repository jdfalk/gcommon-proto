# Guides

The guides section provides step-by-step instructions, best practices, and conceptual overviews for working with gcommon. Content is organized by topic to help new and experienced users alike.

## Directory Structure

```
docs/guides/
├── getting-started/   # Initial setup and first steps
├── architecture/      # Deep dives into system design
├── deployment/        # Packaging and operational guides
└── troubleshooting/   # Common problems and solutions
```

Each subdirectory contains focused guides. Additional topics may be added as the project grows.

## Getting Started

Begin your journey with gcommon using the guides in `getting-started/`:

- Installation prerequisites and environment setup
- Creating a minimal application using core modules
- Configuring authentication and authorization
- Running examples and verifying outputs
- Exploring further learning resources

## Architecture Guides

The `architecture/` directory explains how components fit together:

- High-level system diagrams
- Module interaction patterns
- Scalability and performance considerations
- Data flow and persistence strategies
- Security and isolation boundaries

## Deployment Guides

Operational topics live under `deployment/`:

- Building Docker images for services
- Managing configuration in production
- Monitoring and logging best practices
- Scaling strategies and load balancing
- Disaster recovery and backup planning

## Troubleshooting Guides

- Reporting bugs and contributing fixes

## Writing Guides

When authoring new guides:

1. Start with a clear problem statement or objective.
2. Provide step-by-step instructions with code snippets.
3. Include context on why steps are necessary.
4. Link to reference docs and related guides.
5. Conclude with next steps or additional resources.

## Future Additions

Planned enhancements for the guides section include:

- Interactive tutorials with embedded terminals
- Diagram tooling for architecture walkthroughs
- Automated validation of command snippets
- Searchable index across all guides
- User feedback integration for continuous improvement

Contributions and feedback are welcome. Please submit updates using the documentation update workflow.
