# Production Readiness Checklist

## Objective

Create and execute a comprehensive production readiness checklist for all
gcommon modules. Ensure all modules meet production standards for performance,
security, reliability, and maintainability.

## Context

Before declaring gcommon production-ready, all modules must pass comprehensive
production readiness criteria.

## Production Readiness Criteria

### Performance
- Latency targets met
- Throughput requirements satisfied
- Memory usage within limits
- CPU usage optimized
- Concurrent load handling

### Security
- Security audit completed
- Vulnerabilities addressed
- Access controls implemented
- Data protection ensured
- Compliance requirements met

### Reliability
- Error handling comprehensive
- Graceful degradation implemented
- Circuit breakers functional
- Retry mechanisms working
- Failover capabilities tested

### Observability
- Metrics collection complete
- Logging standardized
- Tracing implemented
- Alerting configured
- Dashboards created

### Operational
- Documentation complete
- Deployment automation working
- Monitoring functional
- Backup/recovery tested
- Runbooks created
