# Task 21: Containerization and Deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Create comprehensive containerization and deployment solutions for gcommon-based applications. This includes Docker images, Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and deployment automation.

## ðŸ“‹ Context

Applications using gcommon need standardized deployment patterns. This task provides production-ready containerization and orchestration solutions.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Requirements

### 1. Docker Images

Create optimized Docker images:

- Multi-stage builds for size optimization
- Security-hardened base images
- Development and production variants
- Performance-optimized configurations

### 2. Kubernetes Manifests

Develop Kubernetes deployment templates:

- Service deployments
- ConfigMaps and Secrets management
- Ingress configurations
- Resource limits and requests
- Health checks and readiness probes

### 3. Helm Charts

Create comprehensive Helm charts:

- Parameterized deployments
- Environment-specific values
- Dependency management
- Upgrade and rollback strategies

### 4. Deployment Automation

Implement deployment automation:

- CI/CD pipeline templates
- GitOps workflows
- Blue-green deployments
- Canary releases
- Automated rollbacks

### 5. Monitoring Integration

Integrate with monitoring systems:

- Prometheus metrics scraping
- Log aggregation configuration
- Distributed tracing setup
- Alert manager integration
