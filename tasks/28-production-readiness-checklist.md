# Task 28: Production Readiness Checklist

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Create and execute a comprehensive production readiness checklist for all gcommon modules. Ensure all modules meet production standards for performance, security, reliability, and maintainability.

## ðŸ“‹ Context

Before declaring gcommon production-ready, all modules must pass comprehensive production readiness criteria.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Requirements

### 1. Production Readiness Criteria

Define criteria for each category:

#### Performance
- Latency targets met
- Throughput requirements satisfied
- Memory usage within limits
- CPU usage optimized
- Concurrent load handling

#### Security
- Security audit completed
- Vulnerabilities addressed
- Access controls implemented
- Data protection ensured
- Compliance requirements met

#### Reliability
- Error handling comprehensive
- Graceful degradation implemented
- Circuit breakers functional
- Retry mechanisms working
- Failover capabilities tested

#### Observability
- Metrics collection complete
- Logging standardized
- Tracing implemented
- Alerting configured
- Dashboards created

#### Operational
- Documentation complete
- Deployment automation working
- Monitoring functional
- Backup/recovery tested
- Runbooks created

### 2. Module Assessment

Assess each module against criteria:

- Config Module assessment
- Queue Module assessment
- Metrics Module assessment
- Auth Module assessment
- Web Module assessment
- Cache Module assessment
- Organization Module assessment
- Notification Module assessment

### 3. Gap Analysis and Remediation

- Identify gaps in readiness
- Prioritize remediation efforts
- Create action plans
- Track progress to completion

### 4. Final Validation

- End-to-end testing
- Load testing
- Security testing
- Operational testing
- Documentation review
