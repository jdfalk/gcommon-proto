# Task 17: Security Audit and Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Conduct comprehensive security audit and implement security best practices
across all gcommon modules. Address security vulnerabilities, implement security
policies, and create security monitoring.

## ðŸ“‹ Context

Security is critical for a library used across multiple services. We need
comprehensive security audit, vulnerability assessment, and security policy
implementation.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Requirements

### 1. Security Audit Framework

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analyzer.go     # Code analysis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dependencies.go # Dependency audit

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ anomalies.go    # Anomaly detection
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ alerts.go       # Security alerts
â””â”€â”€ tools/              # Security tools
    â”œâ”€â”€ crypto.go       # Cryptographic utilities
    â”œâ”€â”€ validation.go   # Input validation
    â””â”€â”€ sanitization.go # Data sanitization
```

### 2. Module Security Reviews

Conduct security reviews for each module:

#### Auth Module Security

- Token security implementation
- Password handling best practices
- Session management security
- Authorization bypass prevention

#### Web Module Security

- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- SQL injection prevention

#### Queue Module Security

- Message encryption
- Access control for queues
- Data integrity verification
- Secure message routing

### 3. Cryptographic Standards

Implement cryptographic best practices:

- Modern encryption algorithms
- Secure key management
- Certificate validation
- Cryptographic randomness

### 4. Security Monitoring

Implement security event monitoring:

- Authentication failures
- Authorization violations
- Suspicious activity patterns
- Security policy violations
