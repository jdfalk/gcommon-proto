# Task 18: Dependency Management and Optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Optimize and manage dependencies across all gcommon modules. Minimize dependency footprint, resolve conflicts, and ensure security of dependencies.

## ðŸ“‹ Context

With 8 modules and numerous external dependencies, proper dependency management is crucial for security, performance, and maintainability.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Requirements

### 1. Dependency Audit

- Analyze all current dependencies
- Identify unused dependencies
- Find dependency conflicts
- Assess security vulnerabilities
- Evaluate performance impact

### 2. Dependency Optimization

- Remove unused dependencies
- Replace heavy dependencies with lighter alternatives
- Consolidate similar dependencies
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Optimize import paths

### 3. Security Scanning

- Implement automated vulnerability scanning
- Monitor for security advisories
- Automatic dependency updates for security fixes
- Dependency license compliance

### 4. Version Management

- Establish dependency version policies
- Implement semantic versioning
- Create dependency update strategy
- Maintain backward compatibility

## âœ… Definition of Done

- [ ] Dependency audit complete
- [ ] Unused dependencies removed
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Automated dependency monitoring
- [ ] Version management policies established

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

1. Reduced dependency footprint
2. No known security vulnerabilities
3. Faster build and test times
4. Clear dependency management policies
5. Automated security monitoring
