"""Interactive API explorer server for generated documentation.

This module launches a lightweight HTTP server that serves API
documentation generated by :mod:`api_doc_generator`. The implementation
is intentionally minimal and focuses on providing a foundation for an
interactive explorer. Future iterations may leverage rich web
frameworks, authentication, and dynamic querying capabilities.

The explorer reads documentation artifacts from the ``proto-docs``
directory and exposes them through a simple web interface. The goal is
to allow developers to browse service definitions, inspect example
requests, and experiment with RPCs in an isolated environment.
