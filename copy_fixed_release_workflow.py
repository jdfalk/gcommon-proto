Copy the fixed release.yml workflow from gcommon to all other repositories.

This script fixes the CI workflow artifact dependency issue by:

- Setting protobuf-artifacts to 'false' by default

Fixed critical CI workflow issues preventing successful builds by removing
problematic protobuf artifact dependencies and simplifying job dependencies.

Issues Addressed:

fix(workflows): remove protobuf artifact dependencies from all build jobs
- Removed generate-protobuf dependency from build-go, build-python, build-frontend, build-docker, build-rust jobs
- Set protobuf-artifacts to 'false' by default to prevent artifact download failures
- Fixed conditional logic that caused jobs to fail when protobuf generation was skipped

fix(workflows): simplify job dependency chain
- Changed from complex conditional protobuf artifact logic to simple language detection
- Removed 'always()' conditions that caused jobs to run even when dependencies failed
- Updated build-status job to only depend on actual build jobs, not protobuf generation

fix(workflows): clean up workflow summary reporting
- Removed reference to generate-protobuf.result in build summary
- Fixed workflow summary table to only show actual build components

Result: CI workflows now run successfully without attempting to download non-existent protobuf artifacts.

Files changed:
- .github/workflows/release.yml - Fixed artifact dependencies and job logic"""
